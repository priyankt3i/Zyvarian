### **Zyvarian Grammar & Syntax Guide**

#### **1. The Alphabet**
Zyvarian uses 16 letters (sounds), each with a unique symbol. Here's the complete alphabet:

| Sound | Symbol | Transliterated Sound |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **a** | 𐓜 | /a/ |
| **i** | 𐓘 | /i/ |
| **u** | 𐓶 | /u/ |
| **e** | 𐓵 | /e/ |
| **o** | 𐓮 | /o/ |
| **m** | 𐓣 | /m/ |
| **k** | 𐓩 | /k/ |
| **s** | 𐓠 | /s/ |
| **n** | 𐓯 | /n/ |
| **t** | 𐓷 | /t/ |
| **l** | 𐓟 | /l/ |
| **p** | 𐓼 | /p/ |
| **r** | 𐓫 | /r/ |
| **z** | 𐓪 | /z/ |
| **d** | 𐓧 | /d/ |
| **v** | 𐓾 | /v/ |

#### **2. Pronunciation**
- **Vowels** are pronounced similarly to their English counterparts.
  - **a** = /a/ (as in **father**)
  - **i** = /i/ (as in **machine**)
  - **u** = /u/ (as in **flute**)
  - **e** = /e/ (as in **bed**)
  - **o** = /o/ (as in **boat**)

- **Consonants** follow the same pronunciation as in English, with the exception of **r** which is rolled.
  - **r** = /r/ (rolled, like in **Spanish** or **Italian**)

#### **3. Sentence Structure**

Zyvarian follows **Subject-Object-Verb (SOV)** word order.

- **Example 1:**
  - English: "I eat food."
  - Zyvarian: "I food eat."  
  - **I** = 𐓜𐓷, **food** = 𐓧𐓠𐓯𐓶, **eat** = 𐓬𐓜𐓶
  - Zyvarian: 𐓜𐓷 𐓧𐓠𐓯𐓶 𐓬𐓜𐓶

- **Example 2:**
  - English: "She speaks Zyvarian."
  - Zyvarian: "She Zyvarian speaks."
  - **She** = 𐓛𐓟, **Zyvarian** = 𐓷𐓮𐓷𐓜𐓵, **speaks** = 𐓠𐓬𐓩𐓷
  - Zyvarian: 𐓛𐓟 𐓷𐓮𐓷𐓜𐓵 𐓠𐓬𐓩𐓷

#### **4. Word Formation**
- **Verb Prefixes:**
  - **ta-** = past tense.
  - **na-** = future tense.

- **Examples:**
  - **ta-** (past): "I ate" = **ta-eat** = 𐓜𐓷 𐓬𐓜𐓶
  - **na-** (future): "I will eat" = **na-eat** = 𐓜𐓷 𐓬𐓜𐓶

- **Pluralization**: To make a word plural, add **-ka** at the end.
  - **cat** = 𐓜𐓩𐓦
  - **cats** = 𐓜𐓩𐓦𐓿𐓛 (cat + ka)

#### **5. Sentence Types**

- **Declarative Sentences:** These are statements.
  - Example: "I am here." = 𐓜𐓷 𐓻𐓯𐓠𐓵
- **Interrogative Sentences:** To form a question, add **"mo"** at the end.
  - Example: "Are you here?" = 𐓜𐓷 𐓻𐓯𐓠𐓵 mo
- **Imperative Sentences:** Used to give commands, no subject needed.
  - Example: "Sit!" = 𐓧𐓠𐓷
  - "Go!" = 𐓧𐓤𐓡

#### **6. Pronouns**
- **I** = 𐓜
- **You** (singular) = 𐓜𐓷
- **He/She/It** = 𐓛
- **We** = 𐓜𐓷𐓷
- **They** = 𐓛𐓧

#### **7. Adjectives and Adverbs**
- Adjectives come **before the noun** in Zyvarian.
  - Example: "Big house" = **Big house** = 𐓒𐓶𐓜 𐓜𐓯𐓮
- Adverbs modify verbs, and they come **after the verb**.
  - Example: "She runs fast" = 𐓛𐓟 𐓠𐓷𐓠𐓷 𐓜𐓶𐓵
  - "He eats slowly" = 𐓜𐓷 𐓬𐓜𐓶 𐓤𐓶𐓩𐓿

#### **8. Prepositions**
- Common prepositions include:
  - **in** = 𐓯𐓷
  - **on** = 𐓣𐓶
  - **under** = 𐓜𐓩𐓣

#### **9. Tenses**
- **Present Tense:** Default verb form (no prefix).
  - Example: "I eat" = 𐓜𐓷 𐓬𐓜𐓶
- **Past Tense:** Add **ta-** to the verb.
  - Example: "I ate" = 𐓜𐓷 𐓬𐓜𐓶 (ta- prefix)
- **Future Tense:** Add **na-** to the verb.
  - Example: "I will eat" = 𐓜𐓷 𐓬𐓜𐓶 (na- prefix)

#### **10. Questions**
- In Zyvarian, a question is formed by adding **mo** at the end of the sentence.
  - Example: "Do you understand?" = 𐓜𐓷 𐓠𐓤𐓡𐓷 mo
